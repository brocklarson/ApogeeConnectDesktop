# Apogee Connect
Apogee Connect for desktop is an application used for sensors built by Apogee Instruments, Inc. I was the solo developer on this project as an employee for Apogee Instruments. 

This app was built from the ground up in an effort to update  and combine functionality of several Apogee applications. It is currently in beta testing but this serves as a sneak peak of the app! It is built in python using the PySide6 GUI library in correlation with qasync, asyncio, and bleak to accomodate asynchronous communication with some sensors such as Apogee's Bluetooth Low Energy sensors.

This app works with Apogee sensors using the following communication protocols:
    - USB Serial
    - Bluetooth Low Energy
    - Modbus
    - SDI-12
